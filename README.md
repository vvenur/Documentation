Stacks
  As mentioned in the first email
    - Created a stack manually and site address 107.21.88.12
    - Created a stack built by using cloud formation, which was deleted.
    
Note:
  Yum was locking this(4/30) evening and so the cloud formation build took long time to complete.

Comments:
     1. In the Architecture documentation has two peices, one I did while the environment was not available wanted to document the options and include the cloud formation architecture also today.
     2.Implementation steps document was also created before the environment was available. 
     3.I have automated the installation and set up using shell scripts in the cloud formation script
     
Ref:
    used AWS documentation to create the cloud formation scripts.
